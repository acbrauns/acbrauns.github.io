				<h2>Static and Dynamic Typing</h2>

				<p>For static typed programming languages, variables must be defined as a certain type before they are used. Java, for example, would be confused if you simply began a program with x=5. Instead, you must declare what the type of variable x is, like this:</p>

		<pre>
			int x;
			x = 5;
		</pre>

		<p>You can also simply declare it as int x =5 (either is fine, but one is usually more fitting than the other depending on the context.) For a dynamic typed program, such as Ruby, the type does not need to be declared. Let&#39s say I wanted to create a method that takes an array as input. The method declaration would be something like:</p>

		<pre>
			def method (input)
				some_value = input[0]
			end
		</pre>

		<p>So what type of array is the input? Strings? Ints? Pandas? Who&#39s to say? Ruby don&#39t care! That&#39s why it&#39s dynamic. I can call method([1, 2, 3]), or I can call method([&quota&quot, &quotb&quot, &quotc&quot]), or I can call method([panda1, panda2, panda3]). (This last one assumes that I have for some reason created a Panda class and have created 3 Panda objects). This seems great, because I can call method(input) and have the return value be an int, a string, or an object.</p>

		<p>Now, it really gets crazy when you consider this: the way this method is set up, input could even be a word! If I call method(&quotword&quot), then the return value some_value will be &quotw&quot.</p>

		<p>What if we tried to do this with Java? To declare a similar method, we would have to declare that it is an array using [], and we would have to declare it as one of these:</p>

		<pre>
			method (String [] input){
				String s = input[0];
				return s;
			}
		</pre>

		<p>It seems to set so many unnecessary boundaries. It just seems like an overly strict parent, doesn&#39t it? No fun at all? Unless, maybe its annoying stiffness is actually there to help us. If I have not yet declared input as a variable, Java will freak out because it does not recognize it. But that can be helpful. Consider the following code in Ruby:</p>

		<pre>
			some_value = 9;
			x = 1;
			som_value = 9 + x;
		</pre>

		<p>What if, while coding in Ruby, I made a typo the second time and typed &quotsom_value&quot? I would be left with two variables: some_value and som_value, so now some_value = 9 and som_value = 10. That&#39s going to confuse things later when I refer to some_value, expecting it to be 10.</p>

		<p>Java, or any static typed language, proves to be advantageous in this case. In addition, sometimes it&#39s harder to keep track of what a method should take in or return. If I want to create a method that takes an array of integers and returns the average value, strings have no business in that method. Sometimes the return value HAS to be a certain type, and that&#39s harder to control in dynamic typed languages. Sometimes in Ruby I think to myself, &quotWait, I have no idea what argument this method wants! Strings? Ints? Pandas?&quot And then I miss Java, where everything was so clearly spelled out.</p>

		<p>I initially was really annoyed with Ruby, finding its loose, dynamic capabilities almost immoral. It was the harlot of programming languages. Maybe that&#39s too harsh of an analogy. I guess if Java is the strict parent, then Ruby is Lorelai from <i>Gilmore Girls</i>. But now, I see the value of both static typed languages and dynamic languages. You need both strict boundaries and freedom. Eat your vegetables, but still have fun on the weekends. Or something.</p>
