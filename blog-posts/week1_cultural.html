				<h2>Dev Bootcamp Culture: Chefs in the Kitchen</h2>

				<p>Let me start off by saying this: so far, everyone from Dev Bootcamp who I have met, either via Google Hangouts or in person, has been incredibly friendly, fun, and good at communicating. It's only been a week and I already feel like I have new friends. That in itself gives me hope about what the culture of Dev Bootcamp is going to be like once we head to the city.</p>

				<p>However, I would be lying if I said I didn&#39t have some other reservations. First off, I do agree that we live in a consumer culture where people have a strong sense of entitlement and expectation. I agree that that is a mindset to attempt to overcome, not only at Dev Bootcamp but in any situation. I also agree that we have had "education trauma". We are given the cirriculum, told what we have to know, and we cross our fingers and hope that what we studied carefully will be on the test. That was college for me, and it was pretty ridiculous.</p>

				<p>That being said, I expected a little more guidance than there has been in the first week. I really do want to have the "kitchen mentality", but that is hard to do when we are not physically in the same location as other students and leaders (during Phase 0). Also, there have been many times within the last week where I felt that the expectations for the challenges weren't completely clear. Even when giving it my best effort and as much time as I had, I felt like there was not enough guidance, at least with getting started.</p>

				<p>On the other hand, I think the gaps that seems like a lack of guidance right now will ultimately be filled in later on. Either way I have hope that I will learn a lot and meet some wonderful people in the DBC community.</p>
