			<h2>Technical Blog: My Three Favorite Sites</h2>

			<h3>eBay</h3>
			<p>This is one of my all-time favorite websites. My eye is drawn to the colorful eBay logo and to the search box on the page. This probably is the most important area of the site. I would describe it was as fun, organized, clean, consistent, and colorful. </p>

			<p>This site is used for online shopping. The site allows for anyone to buy and sell things online easily. The content on the main page is comprised of items for sale on eBay that would appeal to their user based on their previous purchases as well as other items.</p>

			<p>It is very easy to find what you are looking for because the search tools are extremely customizable. I personally think it is actually easier to implement search filters on eBay than on Amazon (by price, category, and specifics within each category). Each page is fairly intuitive to use as it maintains a consistent theme across all pages.</p>

			<p>After being on the site for a while, I still want to search for more things! I find it really fun to use, and I feel kind of proud of myself for being an eBay ninja who is capable of finding really good deals and never having to drive to the store to get things. I buy lots of stuff on eBay because it is extremely functional on a practical level, and visually appealing and clear.</p>
			<p></p>

			<h3>Google</h3>

			<p>Although this is the biggest search engine and the best-known tech company in the world, when I searched my heart, Google really, truly is my favorite site. It&#39s incredibly user-friendly, clean, and more effective at finding the information you are looking for than going directly to a particular site&#45a lot of the time, anyway. It manages to contain an amazing amount of customizability and information without looking cluttered. It is intuitive to use. Its main page is simple and not visually over-stimulating. </p>

			<p>Google&#39s main page is like no other site&#39s main page. It&#39s just the Google icon and the search bar. That&#39s it. It&#39s the only thing that you see, giving it a clean appearance. It&#39s also very fun (especially with the occasional Google doodle).  If you compare to other search engines, Google is by far the least annoying visually. Yahoo, for example is completely cluttered, which a little search bar at the top. It is ugly and over-stimulating. Google understands that and keeps it simple.</p>

			<p>Here&#39s how I see Google, and why I love it so much: it filters through all of the poorly organized websites that exist and actually finds the relevant information. If I wanted to find the address of La Belle Day Spa (or some other place), I would go to Google and type &#34La Belle Day Spa address&#34 and see it immediately. It would actually take longer to navigate to the LaBelle website and find the address of the location I want than to just use Google.</p>

			<p>It is easy to browse through the results, whether looking in web or images. It is also the best way to look for videos. I never look on YouTube, I look on Google Video. That will include YouTube results and other video players (such as Vimeo, and every other non-YouTube video player).</p>

			<p>If I get into a compulsive Googling rabbit-hole (which I often do), I still find it fun. It is an amazing why to find new things and make the information on the Internet even more easily accessible. I believe Google is a playground for knowledge and creativity!</p>
			<p></p>

			<h3>Facebook (but also, I hate it*)</h3>
			<p>I actually hate Facebook for the time being as a concept and have deactivated my account, but in terms of user-interface design, I think it does a really good job. It has a very clean, streamlined look. The first thing that stands out is the blue &#34f&#34 icon.</p>

			<p>Despite my reservations about it, I think it has a good layout. It is intuitive to use, and easy to navigate to friend&#39s pages. Because Facebook actually limits the amount of customizability (everyone&#39s page is still blue, the exact same format) it makes it look cleaner. At the same time, being able to add your own photo makes the user feel like they can customize and make it their own, without making it look terrible like MySpace. It that sense, Facebook is able to strike a very good balance.</p>

			<p>There have been times where Facebook has actually been very helpful. Reconnecting with people from my past would not have been possible without it. It also makes sharing things with friends very easy, more so than email would.</p>

			<p>However, the fact that people often find it hard to &#34quit&#34 Facebook probably says something significant about it: it can be addicting. Not addicting in the fun way, like eBay or Google, addicting in the way that makes you go, &#34Why did I waste so much time here? Why? I didn&#39t do anything for the last thirty minutes! I could have just watched an entire episode of <i>Parks and Recreation!</i>&#34  Nonetheless, I have to give it props for doing what it is meant to do and being designed well.</p>

			<p>*If not used properly, social networking such as Facebook can lead to self-glorification, miscommunication, privacy violation, time wasting, comparison/judgment, having to maintain contact with people who you would prefer not to, and looking at your computer screen instead of talking to a three-dimensional person. Can still be an incredibly helpful tool in keeping in touch with people who you DO want to communicate with, and sharing cat videos.</p>
